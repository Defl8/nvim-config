# nvim-config
Repository for storing my personal Neovim configuration.

## Optimized Lazy Config
- After toying with a more native config, I came to the conclusion that I enjoy
how lazy handles plugins better.

- Using the philosophy of only loading plugins when necessary led to me trying
to optimize my config so that it had the lowest startup time without
comprimising functionality.

- I am very happy with the current state of my config and view it as a near
full IDE replacement.

## Future Additions
- [ ] Debugger configs (still new to using a debugger in nvim)

## Plugins
- TODO
