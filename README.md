# nvim-config
Repository for storing my personal Neovim configuration.

## Minimalist Rework
- Unsatified with the structure of my Lazy config, I decided to move to a more native approach.
- Still uses a few plugins that I consider a core part of my workflow, listed below.
- Heavily inspired by [Sylvan Franklin](https://www.youtube.com/@sylvanfranklin)
