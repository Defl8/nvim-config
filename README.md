# nvim-config
Repository for storing personal Neovim configuration.

## Rework
The whole config has been redone from scratch and now uses [Lazy](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) as the package manager.

## Plugins
The plugins being currently used can be found in my [NeoVim Config](https://github.com/stars/Defl8/lists/neovim-config) list.

## Config language
All the config structure is done in [Lua](https://github.com/lua/lua).
